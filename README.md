## Introduction

This is a full-fledged Instagram clone built using React Native and Firebase. It provides a similar user experience to the official Instagram app, allowing users to sign up, log in, view their feed, create new posts, and like posts. The app uses Firebase for authentication and storage, Formik and Yup for form management and validation, and Yarn as the package manager.

## Features

* User Authentication: Sign up and log in securely using an email and password.
* Feed: View posts from users you follow and yourself on the main feed.
* Upload posts: Share photos with captions, just like in Instagram.
* Like posts: Interact with posts by clicking the like button.
